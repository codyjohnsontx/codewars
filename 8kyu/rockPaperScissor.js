// Rules of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game are:

// Rock beats Scissors,
// Scissors beat Paper,
// Paper beats Rock,
// Two identical moves are a draw.
// Let's play! You will be given valid moves of two Rock, Paper, Scissors players, and have to return which player won: "Player 1 won!" for player 1, and "Player 2 won!" for player 2. In case of a draw return Draw!.

// Examples:
// "scissors",     "paper"     --> "Player 1 won!"
// "scissors",     "rock"      --> "Player 2 won!"
// "paper",        "paper"     --> "Draw!"

// Solution
function rps(player1, player2) {
  if (player1 === player2) {
    return 'Draw!';
  }

  if (
    (player1 === 'rock' && player2 === 'scissors') ||
    (player1 === 'scissors' && player2 === 'paper') ||
    (player1 === 'paper' && player2 === 'rock')
  ) {
    return 'Player 1 won!';
  }

  return 'Player 2 won!';
}
